# weather-app

Create a weather app which tells me a list of things to put in my running bag based on the weather outside. e.g. if its raining, I should have my jacket. If its sunny, I should have my. if its cold I should include my wind proof.

- Use only only javascript, html and css (no libraries/frameworks)
- use the project as a way to learn promises/async/await/fetch methods
- use weatherapi.com
